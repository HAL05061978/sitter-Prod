# Reschedule UI Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SQL Function Error
**Problem**: `{"success":false,"error":"null value in column \"new_request_id\" of relation \"care_reschedule_requests\" violates not-null constraint"}`

**Root Cause**: The `initiate_reschedule_request` function was trying to insert a NULL value for `new_request_id` because it was creating the reschedule request record before creating the new care request.

**Solution**: Reordered the operations in the function to:
1. Create the new care request first
2. Get the new request ID
3. Create the reschedule request record with the new request ID

### 2. UI Component Updates

#### RescheduleModal.tsx
**Changes Made**:
- Replaced complex manual database operations with a single function call
- Updated to use `initiate_reschedule_request` RPC function
- Simplified error handling
- Reduced code complexity from ~100 lines to ~25 lines

**Before**:
```typescript
// Complex manual operations:
// 1. Get original request
// 2. Create new request data object
// 3. Insert new request
// 4. Create reschedule request record
// 5. Update original request
// 6. Create notifications
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Single function call:
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('initiate_reschedule_request', {
  p_original_request_id: careBlock.related_request_id,
  p_new_date: newDate,
  p_new_start_time: newStartTime,
  p_new_end_time: newEndTime,
  p_reschedule_reason: reason
});
```

#### RescheduleResponseModal.tsx
**Changes Made**:
- Updated function call from `handle_reschedule_response_complete` to `handle_reschedule_response`
- No other changes needed as the interface remains the same

## New Workflow Implementation

### Database Functions Created

1. **`initiate_reschedule_request()`**
   - Creates new care request for rescheduled time
   - Creates new providing care block for Parent A
   - Removes Parent A's child from original block
   - Marks original block as cancelled
   - Sends notifications to all participating parents

2. **`handle_reschedule_response()`**
   - Processes individual parent responses (accept/decline)
   - Updates blocks based on response
   - Handles reciprocal block logic
   - Completes reschedule when all parents respond

### Workflow Steps

1. **Parent A initiates reschedule**:
   - New time block created in Parent A's calendar
   - Parent A's child moved to new block
   - Original block marked as cancelled (but kept for tracking)
   - Notifications sent to all participating parents

2. **Parents respond**:
   - **Accept**: Their block updated to new time, child added to Parent A's new block
   - **Decline**: Child removed from original block, reciprocal block handled appropriately

3. **Completion**:
   - When all parents respond, original block deleted from Parent A's calendar
   - Reschedule request marked as completed

## Files Modified

### SQL Files
- `NEW_RESCHEDULE_WORKFLOW.sql` - Fixed NOT NULL constraint issue
- `TEST_FIXED_RESCHEDULE_FUNCTIONS.sql` - Test script for verification

### UI Components
- `components/care/RescheduleModal.tsx` - Updated to use new function
- `components/care/RescheduleResponseModal.tsx` - Updated function name

### Documentation
- `NEW_RESCHEDULE_WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete workflow documentation
- `RESCHEDULE_UI_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **All Parents Accept** - Happy path testing
2. **Mixed Accept/Decline** - Tests reciprocal block logic
3. **All Parents Decline** - Tests complete rejection handling

### Test Files
- `TEST_NEW_RESCHEDULE_WORKFLOW.sql` - Comprehensive test scenarios
- `TEST_FIXED_RESCHEDULE_FUNCTIONS.sql` - Fixed function verification

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Simplified UI Code**: Reduced complexity in frontend components
2. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in database functions
3. **Consistent Workflow**: All reschedule logic handled in one place
4. **Proper Block Management**: Original blocks properly cancelled and new blocks created
5. **Sequential Response Handling**: Each parent's response handled individually
6. **Reciprocal Block Logic**: Declining parents' reciprocal blocks handled based on other children

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy SQL Functions**: Run the updated `NEW_RESCHEDULE_WORKFLOW.sql` in your database
2. **Test Functions**: Run `TEST_FIXED_RESCHEDULE_FUNCTIONS.sql` to verify everything works
3. **Update Frontend**: The UI components are already updated and ready to use
4. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues in production and adjust as needed

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can:
1. Revert the UI components to their previous state
2. Keep using the old reschedule functions
3. The new functions don't interfere with existing functionality

The new implementation is backward compatible and doesn't break existing reschedule requests.
