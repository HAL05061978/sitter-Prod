-- Clear ALL scheduling, invitation, and calendar records for fresh testing
-- This will completely reset your schedule data

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: SHOW CURRENT STATE BEFORE CLEARING
-- ============================================================================

SELECT '=== BEFORE CLEARING - CURRENT RECORD COUNTS ===' as info;

-- Check current record counts
SELECT 'Care Requests' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM care_requests;

-- Show some sample records to understand what's there
SELECT '=== SAMPLE CARE REQUESTS ===' as info;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: CLEAR ALL RECORDS IN THE CORRECT ORDER
-- ============================================================================

-- Clear care responses first (they reference care_requests)

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 3: VERIFY CLEARING WAS SUCCESSFUL
-- ============================================================================

-- Check record counts AFTER clearing
SELECT 'Care Requests' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM care_requests;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 4: FINAL CONFIRMATION
-- ============================================================================

SELECT 'üéâ All scheduling, invitation, and calendar records have been cleared!' as note;
SELECT 'Your calendar should now be completely empty and ready for fresh testing.' as note;
SELECT 'You can now test the reciprocal request flow from scratch.' as note;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 5: TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
-- ============================================================================

SELECT '=== NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING ===' as info;

SELECT '2. Have Parent B respond with reciprocal care times' as step;
SELECT '3. Verify Parent A can see and accept the response' as step;
SELECT '4. Check that both initial and reciprocal time blocks appear in calendar' as step;
SELECT '5. Verify multiple parents can respond until Parent A chooses one' as step;
