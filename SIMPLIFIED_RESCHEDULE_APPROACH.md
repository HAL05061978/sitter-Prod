# SIMPLIFIED RESCHEDULE APPROACH

## Current Problems:
1. **Too many tables**: `care_reschedule_requests`, `care_responses`, `care_requests` - confusing
2. **Complex logic**: Multiple functions trying to manage different states
3. **Data inconsistency**: Children not properly moved between blocks
4. **Original block deletion**: Should remain visible with other children

## Proposed Solution: Use Existing `care_responses` Table

### How it would work:
1. **Reschedule Request** = A special type of `care_request` with `request_type = 'reschedule'`
2. **Reschedule Responses** = Regular `care_responses` with special handling
3. **No new tables needed** - use existing structure

### Workflow:
1. **Parent A initiates reschedule**:
   - Creates new `care_request` with `request_type = 'reschedule'`
   - Creates new providing block for Parent A at new time
   - Removes Parent A's child from original block (but keeps block visible)
   - Sends notifications to participating parents

2. **Parents respond**:
   - Use existing `care_responses` table
   - If accepted: Move their child to new blocks
   - If declined: Keep their child in original block

3. **When all respond**:
   - Delete original block only if all children moved
   - Update all new blocks with final children list

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Simpler**: Uses existing tables and logic
- ✅ **Consistent**: Same pattern as reciprocal/open_block requests
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Less complex code
- ✅ **Familiar**: Developers already understand the pattern

### Implementation:
1. **Modify existing functions** instead of creating new ones
2. **Add reschedule logic** to existing `handle_care_response` function
3. **Use existing notification system**
4. **Leverage existing UI components**

This approach would be much cleaner and easier to maintain!
