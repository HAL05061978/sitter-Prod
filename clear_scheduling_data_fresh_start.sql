-- Clear All Scheduling Data for Fresh Start
-- This script safely clears all scheduling-related records while preserving fundamental app data
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: Verify what we're clearing (for safety)
-- ============================================================================

-- Show current scheduling data counts
SELECT 
    'Current Data Counts' as info,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.scheduled_blocks) as scheduled_blocks_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.babysitting_requests) as babysitting_requests_count,

    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.invitation_time_blocks) as invitation_time_blocks_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.block_connections) as block_connections_count;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: Clear all scheduling-related data in correct order (respecting foreign keys)
-- ============================================================================

-- Clear block connections first (they reference scheduled_blocks)
DELETE FROM public.block_connections;

-- Clear scheduled blocks (calendar events)
DELETE FROM public.scheduled_blocks;

-- Clear request responses
DELETE FROM public.request_responses;

-- Clear babysitting requests
DELETE FROM public.babysitting_requests;

-- Clear group invitations
DELETE FROM public.group_invitations;

-- Clear invitation time blocks
DELETE FROM public.invitation_time_blocks;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 3: Verify fundamental data is preserved
-- ============================================================================

-- Show preserved data counts
SELECT 
    'Preserved Data Counts' as info,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.profiles) as profiles_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.groups) as groups_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.children) as children_count,

    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.child_group_members) as child_group_members_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.messages) as messages_count;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 4: Verify scheduling data is cleared
-- ============================================================================

-- Show cleared data counts (should all be 0)
SELECT 
    'Cleared Data Counts (should be 0)' as info,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.scheduled_blocks) as scheduled_blocks_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.babysitting_requests) as babysitting_requests_count,

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 5: Verify functions still exist
-- ============================================================================

        THEN '‚úÖ get_user_children_for_group exists'
        ELSE '‚ùå get_user_children_for_group missing'
    END as get_children_function_status;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 6: Verify table structure is intact
-- ============================================================================

-- Check that all scheduling tables still exist and have correct structure
SELECT 
    'Table Structure Verification' as info,
    CASE 
        WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'scheduled_blocks') 
        THEN '‚úÖ scheduled_blocks table exists'
